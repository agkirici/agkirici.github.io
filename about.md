<p>Hi there! I am a <strong>biologist with a background of bioinformatics and developing software</strong>, currently working as a <strong>Project Analyst at Astraea Bio</strong>, where I support spatial-omics projects, build lightweight bioinformatics pipelines, and contribute to cross-functional operations. I also serve as an <strong>Executive Member at Panoramics â€“ A Vision</strong>, helping design digital platforms, analyze multi-omics datasets, and engage the scientific community.</p>

<p>My expertise includes <strong>spatial biology, single-cell transcriptomics, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), molecular diagnostics, and computational biology</strong>, 
alongside programming skills in <strong>Python, R, Seurat, Scanpy, HTML/CSS/JS</strong>. 
Iâ€™m passionate about combining a strong biology foundation with computational tools to turn complex datasets into actionable insights.</p>

<p>ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m <strong>actively seeking opportunities</strong> in Canada, and Iâ€™m equally open to <strong>remote roles worldwide</strong> where I can contribute my interdisciplinary expertise.</p>

  <summary>My Background</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>I began my academic path with a <b>BSc in Biological Sciences at Ankara University</b>, where I built my foundation in molecular biology and genetics.</li>
    <li>I then pursued a <b>Masterâ€™s in Biology (Biotechnology, Ankara University)</b>, focusing on transcription factors (<i>YABBY</i> and <i>DOF</i>) under drought stress in <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>. During this time, I also supervised undergraduate thesis projects and presented award-winning posters at international conferences in Paris.</li>
    <li>My first international research experience was at <b>Wageningen University (Netherlands)</b>, where I worked on <b>plant physiology and seed dormancy</b>, contributing to a publication in <i>Journal of Experimental Botany</i> (2018).</li>
    <li>After moving into the health sciences, I joined <b>Mikrogen Genetic Disease Diagnostic Center (Turkey)</b> as a <b>Senior Biologist</b>, leading workflows for <b>whole-exome, whole-genome, and targeted genetic testing</b> in oncology, prenatal, and rare disease diagnostics.</li>
    <li>In <b>2021</b>, I moved to Canada to study <b>Computer Programming at Seneca College</b>, which gave me the opportunity to combine my strong molecular biology background with <b>technology and data-driven approaches</b>. This transition opened the path toward bioinformatics and software development.</li>
    <li>During the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic, I contributed as a <b>healthcare worker at Tikkle Scientific (Canada)</b>, performing large-scale <b>RT-PCR testing</b> for both clinical and film industry clients at the <b>CBS stage</b>.</li>
    <li>More recently, I transitioned into the bioinformatics side, working as a <b>Project Analyst at Astraea Bio</b>, where I combine my wet lab expertise with computational tools to analyze <b>spatial omics datasets (Stomics, MSI, COMET)</b> and streamline project operations.</li>
    <li>I also serve as an <b>Executive Member at Panoramics â€“ A Vision</b>, contributing as a computational creative and software developer.</li>
