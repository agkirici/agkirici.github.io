<p>Hi there! I am a <strong>biologist and bioinformatician/software developer</strong>, 
currently working as a <strong>Project Analyst at Astraea Bio</strong>, where I support 
spatial-omics projects, build lightweight bioinformatics pipelines, and contribute to 
cross-functional operations. I also serve as an <strong>Executive Member at Panoramics â€“ A Vision</strong>, 
helping design digital platforms, analyze multi-omics datasets, and engage the scientific community.</p>

<p>My expertise includes <strong>spatial biology, single-cell transcriptomics, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), molecular diagnostics, and computational biology</strong>, 
alongside programming skills in <strong>Python, R, Seurat, Scanpy, HTML/CSS/JS</strong>. 
Iâ€™m passionate about combining a strong biology foundation with computational tools to turn complex datasets into actionable insights.</p>

<p>ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m <strong>actively seeking opportunities</strong> in Canada, and Iâ€™m equally open to <strong>remote roles worldwide</strong> where I can contribute my interdisciplinary expertise.</p>
