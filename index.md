Hi there! I am a **biologist and bioinformatician/software developer**, currently working as a **Project Analyst at Astraea Bio**, where I support spatial-omics projects, build lightweight bioinformatics pipelines, and contribute to cross-functional operations. I also serve as an **Executive Member at Panoramics â€“ A Vision**, helping design digital platforms, analyze multi-omics datasets, and engage the scientific community.

My expertise includes **spatial biology, single-cell transcriptomics, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), molecular diagnostics, and computational biology**, alongside programming skills in **Python, R, Seurat, Scanpy, HTML/CSS/JS**. Iâ€™m passionate about combining a strong biology foundation with computational tools to turn complex datasets into actionable insights.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m **actively seeking opportunities** in Canada, and Iâ€™m equally open to **remote roles worldwide** where I can contribute my interdisciplinary expertise.

  <summary>ðŸ§¬ My background</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>I began my academic path with a <strong>BSc in Biological Sciences at Ankara University</strong>, where I built my foundation in molecular biology and genetics.</li>
    <li>I then pursued a <strong>Masterâ€™s in Biology (Biotechnology, Ankara University)</strong>, focusing on transcription factors (<em>YABBY</em> and <em>DOF</em>) under drought stress in <em>Phaseolus vulgaris</em>. During this time, I also supervised undergraduate thesis projects and presented award-winning posters at international conferences in Paris.</li>
    <li>My first international research experience was at <strong>Wageningen University (Netherlands)</strong>, where I worked on <strong>plant physiology and seed dormancy</strong>, contributing to a publication in <em>Journal of Experimental Botany</em> (2018).</li>
    <li>After moving into the health sciences, I joined <strong>Mikrogen Genetic Disease Diagnostic Center (Turkey)</strong> as a <strong>Senior Biologist</strong>, leading workflows for <strong>whole-exome, whole-genome, and targeted genetic testing</strong> in oncology, prenatal, and rare disease diagnostics.</li>
    <li>In <strong>2021, I moved to Canada to study Computer Programming at Seneca College</strong>, which gave me the opportunity to combine my strong molecular biology background with <strong>technology and data-driven approaches</strong>. This transition opened the path toward bioinformatics and software development.</li>
    <li>During the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic, I contributed as a <strong>healthcare worker at Tikkle Scientific (Canada)</strong>, performing large-scale <strong>RT-PCR testing</strong> for both clinical and film industry clients at the <strong>CBS stage</strong>. My role involved nucleic acid extraction, qPCR setup, QC interpretation, and ensuring reliable results under strict timelines and safety standards.</li>
    <li>More recently, I transitioned into the bioinformatics side, working as a <strong>Project Analyst at Astraea Bio</strong>, where I combine my wet lab expertise with computational tools to analyze <strong>spatial omics datasets (Stomics, MSI, COMET)</strong> and streamline project operations.</li>
    <li>I also serve as an <strong>Executive Member at Panoramics â€“ A Vision</strong>, contributing as a computational creative and software developer, helping to develop digital platforms, analyze multi-omics data, and engage the scientific community.</li>
