Hi there! I am a **biologist and bioinformatician/software developer**, currently working as a **Project Analyst at Astraea Bio**, where I support spatial-omics projects, build lightweight bioinformatics pipelines, and contribute to cross-functional operations. I also serve as an **Executive Member at Panoramics â€“ A Vision**, helping design digital platforms, analyze multi-omics datasets, and engage the scientific community.

My expertise includes **spatial biology, single-cell transcriptomics, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), molecular diagnostics, and computational biology**, alongside programming skills in **Python, R, Seurat, Scanpy, HTML/CSS/JS**. Iâ€™m passionate about combining a strong biology foundation with computational tools to turn complex datasets into actionable insights.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m **actively seeking opportunities** in Canada, and Iâ€™m equally open to **remote roles worldwide** where I can contribute my interdisciplinary expertise.

<summary>ðŸ§¬ My background</summary>

- I began my academic path with a **BSc in Biological Sciences at Ankara University**, where I built my foundation in molecular biology and genetics.
- I then pursued a **Masterâ€™s in Biology (Biotechnology, Ankara University)**, focusing on transcription factors (*YABBY* and *DOF*) under drought stress in *Phaseolus vulgaris*. During this time, I also supervised undergraduate thesis projects and presented award-winning posters at international conferences in Paris.
- My first international research experience was at **Wageningen University (Netherlands)**, where I worked on **plant physiology and seed dormancy**, contributing to a publication in *Journal of Experimental Botany* (2018).
- After moving into the health sciences, I joined **Mikrogen Genetic Disease Diagnostic Center (Turkey)** as a **Senior Biologist**, leading workflows for **whole-exome, whole-genome, and targeted genetic testing** in oncology, prenatal, and rare disease diagnostics.
- In **2021, I moved to Canada to study Computer Programming at Seneca College**, which gave me the opportunity to combine my strong molecular biology background with **technology and data-driven approaches**. This transition opened the path toward bioinformatics and software development.
- During the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic, I contributed as a **healthcare worker at Tikkle Scientific (Canada)**, performing large-scale **RT-PCR testing** for both clinical and film industry clients at the **CBS stage**. My role involved nucleic acid extraction, qPCR setup, QC interpretation, and ensuring reliable results under strict timelines and safety standards.
- More recently, I transitioned into the bioinformatics side, working as a **Project Analyst at Astraea Bio**, where I combine my wet lab expertise with computational tools to analyze **spatial omics datasets (Stomics, MSI, COMET)** and streamline project operations.
- I also serve as an **Executive Member at Panoramics â€“ A Vision**, contributing as a computational creative and software developer, helping to develop digital platforms, analyze multi-omics data, and engage the scientific community.
