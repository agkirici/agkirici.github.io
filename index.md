Hi there! I am a **biologist specializing in genomics, bioinformatics, and spatial biology**, with over **10 years of research experience** across biological, life, and health sciences. I hold BSc and MSc degrees in Biology as well as a Graduate Diploma in Computer Programming, bringing a unique interdisciplinary perspective that bridges molecular biology and computational analysis.  

My expertise includes **spatial omics (Stomics, MSI, COMET), Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), single-cell transcriptomics, molecular diagnostics, and data-driven cancer research**. I am passionate about transforming complex biological data into meaningful insights through computational tools, automation, and statistical methods.  

I am skilled in both **wet lab techniques** (DNA/RNA extraction, qPCR, NGS workflows) and **computational tools** (Python, R, Seurat, Scanpy, HTML/CSS/JS, WordPress). I thrive in collaborative research environments where problem-solving, data curation, and scientific rigor drive innovation.

Currently, I work as a **Project Analyst at Astraea Bio**, where I support spatial omics projects, build lightweight bioinformatics pipelines, and contribute to cross-functional operations. I also volunteer as a **Computational Creative at Panoramics â€“ A Vision**, developing dashboards, cleaning datasets, and designing digital platforms to support the scientific community.  

In addition, I contributed as a **Public Curator for the CReSCENT platform**, integrating and annotating 145+ single-cell RNA-seq datasets (~938,000 cells) focused on neurological diseases and brain cancers to support Brain Canada research initiatives.
