Hi there! I am a **biologist and bioinformatician/software developer**, currently working as a **Project Analyst at Astraea Bio** where I support spatial-omics projects, build lightweight bioinformatics pipelines, and contribute to cross-functional operations. I also serve as an **Executive Member at Panoramics â€“ A Vision**, helping design digital platforms, analyze multi-omics datasets, and engage the scientific community.

My expertise includes **spatial biology, single-cell transcriptomics, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), molecular diagnostics, and computational biology**, alongside programming skills in **Python, R, Seurat, Scanpy, HTML/CSS/JS**. Iâ€™m passionate about combining a strong biology foundation with computational tools to turn complex datasets into actionable insights.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m **actively seeking opportunities** in Canada and Iâ€™m equally open to **remote roles worldwide** where I can contribute my interdisciplinary expertise.
